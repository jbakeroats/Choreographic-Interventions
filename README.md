###Course Structure | [See description below.](#course-description)
Over the course of the semester, we will cover 4 topic areas: Pathways, Shape, Space and Sound+Text. Topics will be introduced through movement-based improvisation exercises. Computational strategies will be examined through code examples and custom software tools. For each topic, students will create a small movement study in 2 stages: the first analog, the second computational with the aim of fully exploring how technology "intervened" and changed the choreographic process.

The class will culminate in a showing of student work. Final projects can either be in the form of a tool to aid in movement practice, an interactive installation or a live performance. 

Because course topics are organized around movement concepts, technical topics will be introduced, re-introduced and re-introduced week to week. 
- Brief overview of camera/computer vision technologies: RGB, IR, Kinect, Mocap...

##Do dancers need to learn how to code?
- In 2016, what do we mean when we say technology?
- What does it mean to be in dialogue with it?
- What does computation have to do with dance?
- Comparing apples and oranges: How has computation changed different artforms? Visual art, sculpture, architecture, music, writing and dance?

##Pathways
So	we	can	draw	with	the	body,	now	what?
- Tracking and visualizing how the body moves through space. 
- What exactly are we tracking? And why are we tracking it?

#####Example in-class improvs:	Synchronized walking. Create	a	ground	painting.

#####Assignment: Make a short phrase that leaves traces of itself in space.

##Shape
Quasimodo,	The	Human	Barbie	Doll,	The	Power	Suit	and	The	Hoop	Skirt.
- Deformities
- Displacements
- & Distortions

#####Example in-class improvs: Shadow-play with moving light. Dancing in suits.

#####Assignment: Create a movement exercise that changes the texture and/or shape of the body.

##Space
Points, lines and curves.
- Defining space.
- Dividing	space.
- Projecting	lines	and	planes.
- Arcs and curves.
- Meshes	and	webs.

#####Example in-class improvs: Walking the grid. Build	a	yarn	sculpture	by	projecting lines from	bodies in	the	room.

#####Assignment: Define	space	with 1 or more bodies.

##Sound + Text
Translating	movement	into	non-visual	media:	Sound	and	Text
- Mapping	movement to sound.
- Mapping	"gesture" to text.
- Appropriating	poetic devices for generating patterns of movement:	Meter, Repetition, Retrograde, Elision, Alliteration and	Rhyme.

#####Example improv: Shushing	walk.	Translate	a	poem	into	movement. "Write"	a	poem	with	movement.

#####Assignment: Create a phrase in dialogue with sound or text.

## Project Development: Weeks 11, 12, 13

Workshop and	user-test	final	project	ideas.

## Showing: Week 14

# Course Description
Most of us are intimately familiar with interfaces where our movement serves as input to control interactive media. Less familiar are systems designed to compel us to dance, to groove, to move in new and unexpected ways.

This class explores the use of interactive media to “choreograph” in the broadest sense of the word from choreography as dance-making to choreography as crowd control. How do you get someone to soften their chest? Eat space? Change level? How do you shake the entire room? How do you orchestrate duets between strangers?

Conceived of as a (re-)introduction to computational media through the lens of dance, students will practice how to apply computational thinking to the craft of choreography.

Using computer vision and a broad range of media from graphics and video, to sound and text, we will look at directing both how people move (quality of movement) as well as where they move (pathways and spatial relationships).

We will evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of the various sensing technologies available to us today. What is the delta between what we can see and feel (strength, hardness, contortion) and what a computer can see and interpret (locations, contours, velocity, acceleration)?

## Pre-requesites
The course is intended both for anyone looking to deepen their practice in working with movement-based interaction regardless of previous experience with movement technique or programming.

As a result, there is no pre-requisite for dance and no pre-requisite for code.	  		  		  		  		  		  		  		  		  
##Grading
- 40% for showing up (on time!) and participating with curiosity and enthusiasm.
- 10% for each topic study.
- 20% for the final project.
- More than 2 unexcused absences qualifies you for a failure.

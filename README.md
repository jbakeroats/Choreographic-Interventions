# Syllabus - Work in Progress

###Structure of the Class
Topics will be introduced through movement-based improvisation exercises.  Computational strategies will be examined through code examples and custom software tools. Designs for interactions will evolve through testing and iteration.

The class will culminate in a showing of student work. Final projects can either be in the form of a tool to aid in movement practice, an interactive installation or a live performance. 

Over the course of the semester, we will cover 4 topic areas: Pathways, Shape, Space and Sound+Text. For each topic, you will create small movement studies in 2 ways, the first analog, the second computational.

##Do dancers need to learn how to code?
- In 2016, what do we mean when we say technology?
- What does it mean to be in dialogue with it?
- What does computation have to do with dance?

##Path
So	we	can	draw	with	the	body,	now	what?
- Tracking how the body moves through space: What exactly are we tracking and what about it is interesting?

#####Example improv:	Create	a	ground	painting.

#####Assignment: Make a short phrase that leaves traces of itself in space.

##Shape
Quasimodo,	The	Human	Barbie	Doll,	The	Power	Suit	and	The	Hoop	Skirt.
- Deformities
- Displacement
- Amplification
- Diminution

#####Example improv:	Shadow-play	with moving light. Dancing in suits.

#####Assignment: Create a movement exercise that changes the texture and/or shape of the body.

##Space
Points, lines and curves.
- Defining space.
- Dividing	space.
- Projecting	lines	and	planes.
- Arcs and curves.
- Meshes	and	webs.

#####Example improv: Build	a	yarn	sculpture	by	projecting lines	from	bodies	in	the	room.

#####Assignment: Define	space	with 1 or more bodies.

##Sound + Text
Translating	movement	into	non-visual	media:	Sound	and	Text
- Mapping	movement to sound.
- Mapping	gesture to text.
- Appropriating	poetic devices for generating patterns of movement:	Meter, Repetition, Retrograde, Elision, Alliteration and	Rhyme.

#####Example improv: Shushing	walk.	Translate	a	poem	into	movement. "Write"	a	poem	with	movement.

#####Assignment: Final	Project	Proposal

## Project Development: Weeks 11, 12, 13

Workshop and	user-test	final	project	ideas.

## Showing: Week 14

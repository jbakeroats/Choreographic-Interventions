# 0.0 Welcome! What are we doing here?

Most of us are intimately familiar with interfaces where our movement serves as input to control interactive media. Less familiar are systems designed to compel us to dance, to groove, to move in new and unexpected ways.

This workbook explores the use of computational media to “choreograph” in the broadest sense of the word from choreography as dance-making to choreography as crowd control. How do you get someone to soften their chest? Eat space? Change level? How do you shake the entire room? How do you orchestrate duets between strangers?

Conceived as an introduction to computational media through the lens of dance, students will practice how to apply computational thinking to the craft of choreography.

Using computer vision and a broad range of media from graphics and video, to sound and text, we will look at directing both how people move (quality of movement) as well as where they move (pathways and spatial relationships).

In sum, this workbook is intended for dancers wanting to know more about code and coders wanting to know more about dance.

Another way of putting it is, this is a workbook intended to introduce you to a new medium of expression.

## 0.1 Questions

What does it mean to be new?

	Something new is something that is beyond our imagination.
	Something we have not yet formed opinions about.
	Something we do not yet have insights into.
	Something that requires further investigation.

Computers have clearly had a major impact on [other art forms](http://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/listings/2016/manus-x-machina), why hasn’t the same happened in dance?

Is it necessary to call it dance *and* technology?

Why mention the technology at all?

When is the use of technology meaningful? When is it just a gimmick?

Such a question has no ready answers. At least this workbook offers none.

Instead, this is a practical/studio art class, which is also why this is a workbook and not a book. It is a series of exercises to help you investigate this question and decide for yourself.

Can you take the technology out of a dance?

Would the dance still be the dance without the technology? Like Don Quixote is still Don Quixote without the lavish sets and costumes?

<iframe width="49.5%" height="28%" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FHLjVBq_zm0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

Or is the technology more like a mutation? Changing the very nature of the dance so that “dance and technology” (separate entities) becomes “dancetech” (harder to break apart)? Like how movement and choreography in a Robert Wilson production is not a dance, anymore than the set and lighting, costumes and make-up are a separable work of visual art. They are all just part of a whole, a gestalt. Each component on its own is meaningless.

What do we mean by technology?

	High frame rate cameras? [Lincoln Center]
	360 cameras? [NYC Ballet]
	Projection? [Japanese Guy]
	Motion capture?
	Sensors?
	Interactive media?
	LEDs?
	Lighting?
	Sound?
	Robots?
	Software?
	Algorithms? (Pathfinder)
	Artificial intelligence?
	Sprung floors?
	Point shoes?
	Spandex?

For our part, we are going to look at code technology you can author) and as a result we will also touch on many of the technologies listed above.

What does technology offer dance?

	Spectacle.

What about increased sensitivity?

	To the dynamics of movement.
	To the range of possible movements.
	To the structures of choreography.

What about increased complexity of choreography?

Why code?

Because code is the medium underlying all of the technology you might want to use, it’s where true authorship happens.

Because code forces you to deconstruct and analyze ideas by reducing them to numbers and instruction, it’s a new lens through which to view the craft choreography.

Because with code you can try more combinations and permutations of an idea in a few seconds than you could by hand in a lifetime.

The artist and educator [Josef Albers](https://www.google.com/search?q=josef+albers&espv=2&biw=1524&bih=739&site=webhp&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjo8L-k7u7OAhVC1R4KHbpSB_oQ_AUIBigB#tbm=isch&q=josef+albers+homage+to+the+square) devoted much of his life to the study of the interaction of color.

How might his work have been different if he had approached it computationally?

	[LIVE CODE EXAMPLE]

Because code means technology with a brain, it also means technology capable of engaging in conversation. (We’ll go more into what this means in Chapter A on Interaction.)

Because programming is fundamentally different from all technology that has come before it.

How is programmable technology different from what has come before?

You are defining the laws of the universe. [Who knows what stories will play out?](http://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/24/magazine/the-brilliance-of-dwarf-fortress.html)


## 0.2 Goal and Approach: How do we investigate new mediums?

Our goal is to create meaningful interactions between dance and other forms of media (sound, video, graphics) through programming.

We will engage in a continuous conversation about how to apply computational thinking to choreography and vice versa, how to apply choreographic thinking to computation.

By choreographic thinking, I mean: Qualities of movement. Pathways of movement. Spatial relationships. Rhythm. Tempo. Groove. Floor patterns. The arc of a dance. The process of describing a dance in a specific and repeatable way.

By computational thinking, I mean: Numbers. Ratios (Proportions). Patterns. Algorithms (Formulas, Calculations). Instructions. Inputs and outputs. Logic. The process of describing a process, a procedure in a specific and repeatable way.

We will increase our sensitivity to the qualities of movement by examining the quantities that define them.

At the same time, we will re-examine computational graphics through the lens of choreography.

Our conversation will be fueled by practical exercises where you will engage all the parts of your brain and body to internalize what is foreign and new and make it a part of yourself and a part of your practice as a choreographer, an artist, a coder.

## 0.3 A Viewpoint of One’s Own


Most importantly, throughout this workbook you will be asked over and over again to come up with your own approaches, your own techniques, your own innovations and solutions for creating a meaningful dialogue between dance and technology in your work.

Thought Exercise: Pick one of the goals listed below and describe how you could use technology to compel or at least encourage a certain kind of movement.

Goals: Eat space. Soften chest. Quake. Walk single-file around the perimeter of a room.

## 0.4 The Drama in Numbers and Ratios

If code is a way to deconstruct movement into numbers and instructions, what exactly do numbers and instructions have to do with dance?

Thought Exercise: What makes a dance, a dance? How do we know what we’re looking at is a dance and not just life?
_______________________________________

As with all other art forms when we ask the “How do we know it’s a ____ and not just life?” the most liberal response is to simply say: intent. And how is intent expressed? Usually through some form of organization. Dances, music, poetry are intentional and therefore organized. Life is not.

Even John Cage’s [4:33](https://www.youtube.com/embed/HypmW4Yd7SY) is organized.

It takes place in a particular kind of venue (concert hall), at a particular time and lasts for a particular duration. Without the captive audience gathered together in a particular venue at a particular time, listening to their own awkward silence for four minutes and thirty-three seconds, 4:33 would not be 4:33.

Dances are organized along two parameters: space and time. Organization often takes the form of rhythm, repeating phrases, motifs and variations thereof. But like 4:33, dances could also simply take the form of defining a space and a time, boundaries within which anything and everything is the dance and without which anything and everything is not the dance.

Underlying any form of organization are numbers or more specifically relationships of numbers.

And these relationships of numbers (ratios) define the dynamics of a work. 4:33 would have a very different arc if it were 0:17 or 3:52:03.

If we were musicians, we might talk about harmony (ratios of frequencies of sound).

If we were architects, we might talk about proportions of space (ratios of distances, areas and volumes).

If we were graphic designers, we might talk about relative RGB (Red, Green, Blue) and HSB (Hue, Saturation, Brightness) values.

Thought Exercise: What ratios, what number relationships are relevant to dance?

## 0.5 Hello Programming!

Before we begin, we have to first explain the world we’re going to inhabit over the course of semester, the world of graphics programming in the Processing programming environment.

You can download Processing here.

If dances are organized along two parameters: space and time. Let’s begin the process of deconstructing space and time into numbers and ratios.

Drawing Exercise: Take an 8.5x11” piece of paper and fold it so that it is proportionally the same as the room you are in. Orient it so that the top of the page is the same as the wall you are facing. How would you describe the relationship between the width (horizontal) and the length (vertical) of the page?
_______________________________________

Plot your location (Point A) in the room on the piece of paper. How would you describe (in English) your location’s relationship to the width and height of the page?
_______________________________________
_______________________________________

Pick someone else in the room. (Or if you are alone, move to a different location in the room.) How would you describe the relationship between the new location (Point B) and your original location (Point A)?
_______________________________________
_______________________________________

Describe 3 different ways to move from point A in the direction of point B.

Variables are data stored in memory on your computer, true. But the true power of variables lies in their ability to define and describe relationships (ratios) between things. Either relationships between two different things (e.g. x-locations of two different people in a room) or between the same thing over time (e.g. x-location of 1 person in frame 1,2,3,4,5, etc. of an animation).

Coding Exercise: Translate the last 3 answers you provided in English above into code.

```
int ax, ay;
int bx, by;

void setup() {
	size(850, 1100);
	ax = width*___;
	ay = height*___;

	bx = ax*___;
	by = ay*___;
}

void draw() {
	background(0);
	ax = ax + ___;
	ay = ay + ___;
	ellipse(ax, ay, 100, 100);
}
```
